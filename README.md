# Watergenics Webiste
I'm so sorry to whoever has to mantain this, especially if that's me.

## Hints
- I'm not a web developer, 
- Everything is done "as close to the metal" as possible, old habits.
- Web componets are used to seprate out designs so they can be reused.
- Accecibilty is important.
- Run lightohuse to see what changes need ot be made before pushing.
  - Over 250ms first paint time on a slow 3G better be worth it.
  - Very much consider mobile, 95% of traffic is going to come from there.
  - Dont make me accept cookies, just dont use them. Can do some minial logging with google alaytics.
